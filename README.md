# Screenshot
Wanted to create a program that took screenshots of a users screen.
I'm having some trouble finding the correct module that would have up to date properties that would allow me to do so. 
I want to take the photo and save it to a users computer. 
Need to make sure that everytime the program the image name is changed so we arent overridding a previous photo.
